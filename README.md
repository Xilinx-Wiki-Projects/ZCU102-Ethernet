## **What to Expect**
When a new version is added that commit is tagged with SOL (Start of Life)

Ex:

`xilinx-v<VERSION>-SOL`

When a version falls off the back of our support window, the final commit will be tagged EOL (End of Life) indicating that no more updates will be made to that design. The directory will then be deleted from the repository.

Ex:

`xilinx-v<VERSION>-EOL`

For more information on a particular version, see the README.md contained within that version's directory.
